# Truck-Fleet-Risk-Analysis-Safety-Intelligence-Using-Big-Data-Analytics
This project analyzes large-scale truck fleet telematics and geographic data to identify high-risk drivers, vehicles, and locations for a national trucking company. Using data ingested into Hadoop/HDFS and Hive, risk factors were calculated based on mileage, speed, and unsafe driving events, then visualized through Tableau dashboards connected via Impala. The analysis highlights the most dangerous drivers, cities with elevated incident rates, and truck models associated with frequent safety violations, enabling data-driven recommendations such as targeted driver training, geo-fencing alerts, model reassignment, and predictive maintenance. The project demonstrates end-to-end big data processing, risk analytics, and executive-level visualization to support operational safety and decision-making.
